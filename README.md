## Introduction

The Course Recommendation System is designed to help users find courses that match their interests by analyzing the patterns and preferences of similar users. The system leverages the KNN algorithm, a popular machine learning technique, to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Features

- Personalized course recommendations based on user preferences
- Implementation of the KNN algorithm
- Easy-to-use interface for users to get recommendations
- Scalable and flexible to accommodate more users and courses

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshul-lal/course_recommendation_KNN.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd course_recommendation_KNN
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the `Course Recommendation System Using KNN.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train the model and get recommendations.**

3. **Modify the user input in the notebook to get personalized course recommendations.**

## Data

The data used for this project consists of user preferences and course information. It includes user ratings for different courses, which are used to find similar users and recommend new courses.

## Model

The KNN algorithm is used to find the most similar users to a given user. Based on the preferences of these similar users, the system recommends new courses. The number of neighbors (K) can be adjusted to tune the performance of the recommendation system.

## Results

The recommendation system has been tested on a sample dataset and has shown promising results in providing personalized course recommendations. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the notebook.
